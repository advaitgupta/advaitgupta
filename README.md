<h3>
    
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Machine Learning at the University of Maryland, College Park, and am part of Prof. Tianyi Zhouâ€™s research lab. My research broadly encompasses machine learning with specific interests in computer vision, natural language processing, multimodal techniques, and generative AI. I am particularly passionate about building intelligent agents that leverage reasoning capabilities to effectively perform vision-related tasks and decision-making processes. Previously, I earned my B.Tech degree in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology where I researched on applying computer vision techniques in healthcare, construction and urban analytics.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2025 to further advance these research interests. I am open to collaboratingâ€”if my research interests and work resonate with you, feel free to reach out to discuss potential opportunities!
